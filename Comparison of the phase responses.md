To provide a qualitative comparison of the phase responses between the Line Of Sight (LOS) and Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) scenarios, consider the following aspects:

### Distribution of Points:

- LOS: The phase responses in the LOS scenario tend to be more clustered around the origin (0,0). This indicates that the multipath components are stronger and their magnitudes are more consistent.
- NLOS: The phase responses in the NLOS scenario are more spread out. This spread indicates weaker multipath components and a greater variation in their magnitudes.
### Density of Points:
- LOS: The higher density of points near the origin suggests that the signal strength remains high and the multipath effects are less pronounced.
- NLOS: The lower density of points near the origin and higher density further away from the origin indicate that the signal strength decreases more rapidly, and the multipath components are more dispersed.
### Outliers:
- LOS: Fewer outliers, with most points concentrated close to the center.
- NLOS: More outliers, indicating a wider range of path gains due to more significant scattering and reflection in a NLOS environment.
### Magnitude of Path Gains:
- LOS: Smaller variations in path gains, implying a more stable signal environment.
- NLOS: Larger variations in path gains, indicating a more complex signal environment with significant attenuation and scattering.
## Suggested Analysis for Qualitative Comparison:
### Calculate and Compare the Mean and Standard Deviation:
Compute the mean and standard deviation of the magnitudes of the path gains for both LOS and NLOS scenarios. This will provide a numerical representation of the spread and central tendency of the data.
### Plot Histograms of Magnitudes:
Plot histograms of the magnitudes of the path gains for LOS and NLOS to visually compare the distributions.
### Analyze Cluster Properties:
Perform clustering analysis (e.g., k-means) on the phase responses to identify distinct clusters and compare the properties (size, centroid, spread) of these clusters between LOS and NLOS.
### Compare Outliers:
Identify and compare the number of outliers and their distances from the origin for both scenarios.
